        Generating our own JavaDocs for our Package.
 =A reliable documentation is a must for a developer. Just imagine how difficult it would be to write code in a language
 you are not familiar with, without proper documentation. Documentation helps us to develop, maintain and transfer knowledge
 to other developers. As you are already aware that there is a proper documentation available for Java. But have you ever
 thought of creating your own documentation? In this tutorial, I will tell you how you can automatically generate documentation
  for your Java packages with the help of JavaDoc.

What is JavaDoc?
=It is a tool that automatically generates standard documentation in HTML format from the Java source code.
This tool comes built-in with JDK( Java Development Kit).

Steps to create documentation with JavaDoc in IntellijIdea :
-Open your java program in IntellijIdea.
-Click on Tools and then select Generate JavaDoc.
-A pop window will open. Select the project and packages for which you want to create the JavaDoc.
-Select the classes for which you want to generate the documentation. By default, documentation will be created for all the classes.
-Select the location where you want to save your JavaDoc by clicking on the Output directory.
-Click on Ok, and your documentation will be saved to your specified location.
