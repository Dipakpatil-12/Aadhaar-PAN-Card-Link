        //Multithreading in Java
//Multiprocessing and multithreading both are used to achieve multitasking

//threads use shared memory area
//        threads = faster content switching
//        A thread is light-weight where a process is heavyweight
//        for example = A word-processor app can have one thread running in foreground as an editor and another in the background
//        auto saving the document !

//Creating a Threading
//  There are two ways to create a thread in java
//       - By extending thread class
//       - By implementing Runnable interface

//Use for achieving the concurrency
