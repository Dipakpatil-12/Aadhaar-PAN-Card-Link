        Is Java interpreted or compiled?
Java is a hybrid language both compiled as well as interpreted.

A JVM can be used to interpret this bytecode
This bytecode can be taken to any platform ( win/ mac / Linux ) for education.
Hence java is platform-independent ( write once run everywhere ).

Executing a java program
java Harry.java  -  compiles

java Harry.class -  Interpreted

So far the execution of our program was being managed by IntelliJ idea.

we can download a source code like VS code to compile & execute our java programs
