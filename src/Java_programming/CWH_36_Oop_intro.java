        Java Tutorial: Basic Terminologies in Object Oriented Programming
Four pillars of Object-Oriented-Programming Language :
1.Abstraction :
Let's suppose you want to turn on the bulb in your room. What do you do to switch on the bulb. You simply press the button
and the light bulb turns on. Right? Notice that here you're only concerned with your final result, i.e., turning on the light bulb.
 You do not care about the circuit of the bulb or how current flows through the bulb. The point here is that you press the switch,
  the bulb turns on! You don't know how the bulb turned on/how the circuit is made because all these details are hidden from you.
   This phenomenon is known as abstraction.
More formally, data abstraction is the way through which only the essential info is shown to the user, and all the internal details
 remain hidden from the user.


2.Polymorphism :
One entity many forms.
The word polymorphism comprises two words, poly which means many, and morph, which means forms.
In OOPs, polymorphism is the property that helps to perform a  single task in different ways.
Let us consider a real-life example of polymorphism. A woman at the same time can be a mother, wife, sister, daughter, etc.
 Here, a woman is an entity having different forms.
Let's take another example, a smartphone can work like a camera as well as like a calculator. So, you can see the a smartphone
is an entity having different forms
