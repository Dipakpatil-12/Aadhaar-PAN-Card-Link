3.Encapsulation :
The act of putting various components together (in a capsule).
In java, the variables and methods are the components that are wrapped inside a single unit named class.
All the methods and variables of a class remain hidden from any other class.
A automatic cold drink vending machine is an example of encapsulation.
Cold drinks inside the machine are data that is wrapped inside a single unit cold drink vending machine.

4.Inheritance :
The act of deriving new things from existing things.
In Java, one class can acquire all the properties and behaviours of other some other class
The class which inherits some other class is known as child class or sub class.
The class which is inherited is known as parent class or super class.
Inheritance helps us to write more efficient code because it increases the reusablity of the code.
Example :
Rickshaw      →        E-Rickshaw
 Phone           →        Smart Phone
